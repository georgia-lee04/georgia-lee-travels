            <h5>About me</h5>
            <p>
              I'm Georgia, a 24-year old living just outside of London - like
              many others I have a huge love for travel which was especially
              sparked by first solo trip last summer to Jordan as part of a
              group tour.
              <br />
              <br />
              I studied at the University of Nottingham obtaining a BA (Hons)
              degree in History, followed by an MSc Psychology degree. Whilst
              still finishing off my final dissertation I began working part
              time with the Alternative Hair Show, which then soon turned into a
              full time position and expanding to involve a position at Sanrizz
              simulateously. Both organisations are linked under the same
              ownership with the Alternative Hair Show being an annual charity
              event in aid of fighting leukaemia and Sanrizz, a hair company
              with a legacy of over 40 years at the forefront of British
              Hairdressing and Education. I really enjoyed my work in both roles
              with highlights including being part of the small team to organise
              and coordinate the Alternative Hair Show at the ExCel London
              (2023) and the Roundhouse in London (2024), writing press releases
              to share with industry magazines and getting to manage social
              media content and work on marketing campaigns.
              <br />
              <br />
              From this I've taken some time to figure out my next direction and
              have upskilled myself through completing the SheCodes Bootcamp
              course over 5 months, through which I have learned HTML, CSS,
              JavaScript, React and how to use frameworks such as Bootstrap. I
              also got the chance to work with API integration, AI technology as
              well as learning responsive design.
              <br />
              <br />
              This website/blog is a way to share my new love for coding as well
              as my love for travel and writing which I hope to keep adding to
              as I embark on more exciting new trips and adventures!
